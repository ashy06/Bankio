The system allows for user account management, transaction tracking, loan applications, and gift card management.  The provided files suggest a partially completed system, requiring further assembly and potentially additional development.

## Features

* **Loan Application System:**  Facilitates the application process for loans, including status tracking (e.g., "Approval Pending", "Rejected").  Requires user document uploads (Aadhar, PAN, Payslip).
* **Gift Card Management:**  Allows users to send and receive gift cards.
* **Firebase Integration:**  Utilizes Firebase for realtime database operations.
